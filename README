Hello!

To get started try "/ttt help".

There are two parts to this project. A tic tac toe portion that has no knowledge of Slack and a Slack portion.

The Slack portion has a set of Commands, models (like a SlackUser) and the Global TicTacToe Slack state (SlackChannelGames).

This is hosted on GAE.
